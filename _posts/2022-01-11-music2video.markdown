Based on the fusion of text and audio, we create video whose content is consistent with the distinct modalities that are provided. A simple approach to automatically segment the video into variable length intervals and maintain time consistency in generated video is part of our method. Our proposed framework for generating music video shows promising results in application level where users can interactively feed in music source and text source to create artistic music videos.
